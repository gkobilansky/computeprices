# GPU Detail Page Redesign

## Overview

The GPU detail pages have been redesigned to provide a more comprehensive and visually appealing product experience. The new design features:

- Enhanced hero section with GPU image and key specifications
- Detailed technical specifications organized by category
- Performance metrics with visualizations
- Pros and cons section
- Feature highlights
- Detailed GPU description
- Improved pricing comparison
- Affiliate links (where applicable)
- Enhanced SEO with structured data

## Accessing the Enhanced Pages

The enhanced GPU detail pages are available at `/gpus/{slug}`, where `{slug}` is the URL-friendly version of the GPU name (e.g., `/gpus/h100` for the NVIDIA H100).

## New Database Schema

The GPU model schema has been enhanced with additional fields to support the new page design. These include:

- `image_url`: Path to the GPU image
- `description`: Short description displayed in the hero section
- `detailed_description`: Comprehensive description shown in the "About" section
- Technical specifications fields:
  - `compute_units`: Number of compute units
  - `cuda_cores`: Number of CUDA cores (NVIDIA)
  - `tensor_cores`: Number of Tensor cores
  - `rt_cores`: Number of RT cores
  - `memory_bandwidth_gbps`: Memory bandwidth in GB/s
  - `memory_interface_bit`: Memory interface width in bits
  - `manufacturing_process_nm`: Manufacturing process in nanometers
  - `tdp_watt`: Thermal Design Power in watts
  - `max_power_watt`: Maximum power consumption in watts
  - `release_date`: GPU release date
  - `end_of_life_date`: End of support date
- Performance metrics:
  - `fp16_performance_tflops`: FP16 performance in TFLOPS
  - `fp32_performance_tflops`: FP32 performance in TFLOPS
  - `fp64_performance_tflops`: FP64 performance in TFLOPS
  - `int8_performance_tops`: INT8 performance in TOPS
  - `ml_perf_inference_score`: MLPerf inference benchmark score
  - `ml_perf_training_score`: MLPerf training benchmark score
- Market data:
  - `msrp_usd`: Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price in USD
  - `server_gpu`: Boolean indicating if this is a server GPU
  - `cloud_compatible`: Boolean indicating cloud compatibility
  - `performance_tier`: Performance category (entry, mid, high, ultra)
  - `generation`: GPU generation number
- Content fields:
  - `pros`: Array of pros
  - `cons`: Array of cons
  - `features`: Array of key features
- Link fields:
  - `benchmark_links`: JSONB object with benchmark links
  - `affiliate_links`: JSONB object with affiliate links

## Enhancing GPU Data

### Option 1: Using SQL

You can enhance GPU data using SQL scripts. A sample script for updating the H100 GPU is provided in `scripts/data-enrichment/populate-sample-gpu-data.sql`. This script can be used as a template for other GPUs.

To apply the script:

```bash
psql -d your_database_name -f scripts/data-enrichment/populate-sample-gpu-data.sql
```

### Option 2: Using the Admin UI

If you have access to the admin interface, you can update GPU data through the web UI:

1. Navigate to the admin section
2. Select "GPU Models" from the menu
3. Click on the GPU you wish to update
4. Fill in the available fields
5. Click "Save"

### Option 3: Automated Data Enrichment

For batch updates, you can use the automated data enrichment script:

```bash
# Add GPU images from public sources
node scripts/data-enrichment/download-gpu-images.js

# Update the database with image URLs
node scripts/data-enrichment/download-gpu-images.js --update-db
```

## Schema Migration

To add the new fields to your database, run the schema migration script:

```bash
psql -d your_database_name -f scripts/data-enrichment/enhance-gpu-model-schema.sql
```

## Best Practices for Content

1. **Images**: Use high-quality images that are free to use or properly licensed. Store them in `/public/images/gpus/` with a consistent naming convention.

2. **Descriptions**: Write concise, informative descriptions that highlight the key features and use cases of the GPU.

3. **Technical Specifications**: Ensure accuracy in all technical specifications, with reliable sources for the data.

4. **Pros and Cons**: Be objective and honest about the strengths and limitations of each GPU.

5. **Use Cases**: Describe specific applications and workloads where the GPU excels.

6. **Affiliate Links**: Only include reputable vendors with reliable service.

## SEO Enhancements

The redesigned pages include structured data for:

- Product information (Schema.org Product)
- FAQ content (Schema.org FAQPage)
- Offers from different providers (Schema.org Offer)

These structured data elements improve search engine visibility and can enable rich results in search engines.

## Performance Considerations

The enhanced pages include more content and images, which may affect page load times. To optimize performance:

1. Use properly sized and compressed images
2. Lazy load content below the fold
3. Use Next.js Image component with appropriate sizing
4. Implement incremental static regeneration for pages

## Future Enhancements

Planned future enhancements to the GPU detail pages include:

1. Interactive performance comparison charts
2. User reviews and ratings
3. Real-time price alerts
4. Price history graphs
5. Community benchmarks
6. More detailed compatibility information
