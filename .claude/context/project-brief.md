# Project Brief

## What It Does
**ComputePrices** is a comprehensive GPU cloud computing price comparison platform that aggregates pricing data from 8+ cloud providers to help users find the most cost-effective GPU resources for machine learning, AI training, and compute-intensive workloads.

## Core Problem Solved
**Challenge:** GPU cloud pricing is fragmented across multiple providers, difficult to compare, and often requires sales conversations to get accurate pricing information.

**Solution:** Automated price aggregation with real-time data collection, technical specifications, and side-by-side comparisons to enable informed decision-making.

## Key Objectives

### 1. Market Transparency
- Provide clear, up-to-date pricing across all major GPU cloud providers
- Eliminate the need for sales calls to get pricing information
- Make GPU cloud computing accessible to smaller organizations and individuals

### 2. Technical Excellence  
- Maintain accurate GPU specifications database
- Ensure reliable automated data collection from provider websites and APIs
- Deliver fast, responsive user experience with static generation

### 3. User Empowerment
- Enable cost optimization through comprehensive comparison tools
- Provide educational content to help users make informed decisions
- Support both technical and business decision-makers

## Success Criteria

### Immediate Success Metrics
- **Data Coverage:** 8+ providers with automated daily updates
- **GPU Database:** Complete specifications for 50+ GPU models
- **Site Performance:** Sub-2 second page load times
- **Data Accuracy:** <24 hour pricing freshness across all providers

### Growth Success Metrics
- **User Engagement:** Newsletter subscriber growth
- **SEO Performance:** Top 3 rankings for "GPU cloud pricing" keywords
- **Provider Relationships:** Potential affiliate partnerships
- **Feature Adoption:** Active usage of comparison tools

### Long-term Success Vision
- **Market Position:** Become the definitive source for GPU cloud pricing
- **Industry Impact:** Influence pricing transparency across the cloud GPU market
- **Revenue Generation:** Sustainable business model through referrals or premium features
- **Platform Evolution:** Expand to CPU, storage, and other cloud resource comparisons

## Project Scope

### In Scope
✅ **GPU Cloud Pricing** - Focus on GPU-enabled cloud computing resources  
✅ **Provider Aggregation** - Multi-provider price comparison  
✅ **Technical Specifications** - Detailed GPU performance data  
✅ **Educational Content** - Learning resources for GPU computing  
✅ **SEO Optimization** - Search engine visibility and organic growth  
✅ **Newsletter Platform** - User engagement and retention  

### Out of Scope (Current Phase)
❌ **CPU-only instances** - Focus remains on GPU resources  
❌ **Bare metal servers** - Cloud-first approach  
❌ **Complex procurement** - Enterprise sales processes  
❌ **Real-time trading** - Not a marketplace, purely informational  
❌ **Provider APIs** - Users still purchase directly from providers  

## Strategic Context
