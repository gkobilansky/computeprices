            Verify and update provider data for: ${{ env.PROVIDER_SLUG }}

            ## Your Task

            We've scraped the provider's website and saved the results to `scraped-data.json`.
            Your job is to compare this fresh web data with our current provider file and update it if needed.

            ## Step 1: Read the Scraped Data

            First, read `scraped-data.json` to see what we found on their website.
            This file contains:
            - Content from their home page
            - Content from their pricing page (if found)
            - Content from their docs page (if found)
            - Content from their features page (if found)
            - GPU mentions, features, pricing info extracted from each page

            ## Step 2: Read Current Provider Data

            Read these files:
            1. `data/providers/PROVIDER_DATA_GUIDELINES.md` - Our standards for provider data
            2. `data/providers/${{ env.PROVIDER_SLUG }}.json` - Current provider data

            ## Step 3: Compare and Identify Issues

            Compare the scraped data with the current JSON file. Look for:

            **Company Information:**
            - Is the company name still correct?
            - Is the tagline accurate or outdated?
            - Is the description accurate?
            - Is the category classification still appropriate?

            **URLs:**
            - Are the website URLs correct?
            - Should we add missing `docsLink` or `pricing_page` if we found them?

            **Features & Services:**
            - Are there new features mentioned on the website that aren't in our data?
            - Are the pros/cons still accurate?
            - Are GPU model offerings up to date?

            **Missing Fields:**
            - According to PROVIDER_DATA_GUIDELINES.md, what recommended fields are missing?
            - Can we populate them from the scraped data?

            ## Step 4: Update Provider File (If Needed)

            If you found discrepancies or missing information:
            - Use Edit tool to update `data/providers/${{ env.PROVIDER_SLUG }}.json`
            - Be conservative - only change what's clearly wrong or add missing information
            - Follow PROVIDER_DATA_GUIDELINES.md for structure and content standards
            - Preserve JSON formatting (2-space indent)
            - **Do NOT change the UUID (id field)**
            - **Do NOT change the slug**

            If the current data is accurate and complete: Make no changes

            ## Step 5: Provide Detailed Summary

            Output a comprehensive summary including:
            - **Pages scraped:** List the URLs that were successfully scraped (from scraped-data.json)
            - **What you verified as accurate:** Specific claims from our JSON that match the scraped data
            - **What you changed and why:** Each change with supporting evidence from the scraped data
            - **Missing information:** Anything we should add but couldn't determine from scraped data
            - **Confidence level:** High/Medium/Low with justification

            ## Important Constraints
            - Do NOT change the provider's UUID (id field)
            - Do NOT change the slug
            - Preserve JSON formatting (2-space indent)
            - Only make factual corrections backed by scraped data
            - Follow PROVIDER_DATA_GUIDELINES.md for content standards
            - Do NOT invent information not present in the scraped data
