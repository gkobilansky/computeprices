Monitoring the cost of GPU infrastructure has never been more important. Every week we compare offerings from hyperscalers and specialized GPU clouds, and we wanted a single place to share what we learn along the way.

## What you can expect

- Deep dives into pricing strategy shifts across major providers
- Playbooks for right-sizing GPU clusters for popular AI workloads
- Industry news that actually impacts procurement teams

## How we source our data

We combine our public scraping pipeline, direct provider partnerships, and community submissions. Every pricing update we publish has a clear source and timestamp so you can track when the change occurred.

```
Providers scraped: 7
Data refresh cadence: Daily (or faster when the market moves)
Price history: 18+ months of archived updates
```

> Have a dataset you think we should incorporate? Reach out at any timeâ€”we love collaborating with teams building on GPUs.
